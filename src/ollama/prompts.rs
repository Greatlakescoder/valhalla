pub const NAME_USER_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an expert system analyst monitoring for suspicious activity in Linux systems.

Analysis rules:
1. Check every process name against common Linux naming patterns
2. Flag suspicious variations of common process names:
   - Misspellings (e.g., systend instead of systemd)
   - Number substitutions (using 0 for o, 1 for l)
   - Unusual suffixes (-miner, -worker, -service)
3. Consider process context:
   - Is this process normally seen on Linux systems?
   - Is the name attempting to look legitimate?
   - Could it be a cryptocurrency miner or malware?

Return a JSON array where each object MUST have these EXACT fields:
{
  "pid": number,           (REQUIRED: process ID as number)
  "name": string,         (REQUIRED: process name in quotes)
  "isMalicious": boolean, (REQUIRED: lowercase true/false, no quotes)
  "reason": string        (REQUIRED: explanation in quotes)
}

CRITICAL RESPONSE RULES:
1. Every single process MUST be included in the output
2. Repeated values are okay, print every single process
3. Comments are invalid in this context like "rest of array similar" or "removed for brevity"
4. Every object MUST have all four fields above
5. Field names MUST match exactly ("isMalicious" not "is_malicious")
6. No trailing commas
7. Double quotes only for strings
8. Boolean must be lowercase (true/false)
9. If you see many similar processes, you MUST still output them all individually

Common legitimate Linux processes for reference:
systemd, system-udevd, sshd, ssh-agent, cron, crond, 
nginx, apache2, postgres, mysql, docker, containerd,
pulseaudio, pipewire, gnome-shell, kde-daemon, dbus-daemon,

pub const RESOURCE_USER_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an expert system analyst monitoring for suspicious resource usage patterns in Linux systems.

Analysis rules:
1. Check process resource patterns for suspicious behavior:
   - Unusually high CPU usage (>80% sustained)
   - Excessive memory consumption
   - Abnormal I/O patterns (constant disk writes/reads)
   - Network connection counts
2. Consider resource usage context:
   - Is this usage pattern normal for this type of process?
   - Does it match known cryptomining patterns?
   - Are there signs of resource abuse or DOS attempts?
3. Flag suspicious combinations:
   - High CPU with hidden network connections
   - Memory leaks or abnormal growth
   - Excessive disk I/O with encrypted content

Return a JSON array where each object MUST have these EXACT fields:
{
  "pid": number,           (REQUIRED: process ID as number)
  "cpu_percent": number,   (REQUIRED: CPU usage as number)
  "memory_mb": number,     (REQUIRED: memory usage in MB as number)
  "isSuspicious": boolean, (REQUIRED: lowercase true/false, no quotes)
  "reason": string        (REQUIRED: detailed explanation in quotes)

CRITICAL RESPONSE RULES:
1. Every single process MUST be included in the output
2. Repeated values are okay, print every single process
3. No comments or truncation allowed
4. Every object MUST have all five fields above
5. Field names MUST match exactly
6. No trailing commas
7. Double quotes only for strings
8. Boolean must be lowercase (true/false)
9. Numbers must not be quoted

Common legitimate resource patterns for reference:
- Database servers: Steady memory, periodic CPU spikes
- Web servers: Moderate CPU, stable memory usage
- System services: Low-moderate resource usage
- Desktop environments: Variable but predictable usage
- Backup processes: High I/O but low CPU usage"#;
